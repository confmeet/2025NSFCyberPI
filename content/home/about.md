The 2025 National Science Foundation CSSI/Cybertraining/SCIPE Principal Investigator Meeting, or 2025 NSF Cyber PI Meeting, brings together PIs and senior personnel from multiple NSF programs: [Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cssi-cyberinfrastructure-sustained-scientific-innovation), [Training-based Workforce Development for Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (CyberTraining)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/training-based-workforce-development-advanced), and [Strengthening the Cyberinfrastructure Professionals Ecosystem (SCIPE)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/strengthening-cyberinfrastructure-professionals-ecosystem).


We also encourage colleagues funded by the [Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cc-campus-cyberinfrastructure), other [Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)](https://new.nsf.gov/cise/oac) programs, and [Computational Science and Data-enabled Engineering (CDS&E)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cdse-computational-data-enabled-science-engineering) to join the event (up to our capacity).
