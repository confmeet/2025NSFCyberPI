Every project represented at the meeting must have a poster that is presented
by a PI or senior personnel.


## Poster Titles and Abstracts

Poster titles and abstracts must be submitted during registration.
The registration links below will take you to a form and contain instructions
for submitting titles and abstracts for a variety of situations.

## Poster Creation and Printing

Posters should be no larger than 3ft (vertically) by 3ft (horizontally), and
should be thin and light enough to be pierced by a tack and affixed to a
cork board.
Previous program attendees have kindly offered to be examples to inspire
poster designs.

poster from a Cyberinfrastructure participant.

Presenters should print their posters and bring them to the conference, or
print them at a local vendor in time for the conference.
We will not provide a list of local print vendors.

## Digital Poster Submission for Archiving

In addition to presenting a printed copy of the poster,
posters must be submitted digitally.
Instructions for digitally submitting and archiving posters, and
sharing DOIs with us are available [in this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd7Gy6FTH5BPS4UHxu50EMOSrNyyIFOKHm4hA93qkUgdvbAjg/viewform?usp=header).
We recommend using Google Chrome to upload posters as other browsers seem to
have difficulty with FigShare.
Digital poster submissions to FigShare and completion of the linked form
must be done BEFORE the meeting.
