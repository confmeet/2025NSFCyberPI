 works: Performance Engineering Scientific Applications with MVAPICH and TAU
  using Emerging Communication Primitives	This research aims to investigate 
 and develop the following innovations by co-designing MVAPICH2 and TAU libr
 aries to scale driving science domains---including AWP-ODC and heFFTe: 1) L
 oad-aware designs for MPI asynchronous communication\, 2) Cross runtime coo
 rdination for MPI+X applications\, 3) Partitioned point-to-point primitives
 \, 4) Application-aware neighborhood collective communication\, 5) Support 
 for adaptive persistent collective communication\, and 6) Coordinating comm
 unication kernels on GPUs. Integrated development and evaluation are carrie
 d out to ensure proper integration of proposed designs with the driving app
 lications\, and closely work with internal and external collaborators to fa
 cilitate wide deployment and adoption of the released software. A synergist
 ic and comprehensive development plan\, involving personnel from OSU\, SDSC
 \, UO\, UTK\, is carried out. The transformative impact of the proposed eff
 ort is to extract the performance and scalability of HPC applications in ne
 xt-generation HPC architectures through intelligent performance engineering

 control/communication stacks. Building on this data-collection layer\, the 
 program dives into ML/edge-computing workflows. Trainees benchmark a family

 g High-Resolution Observations and Machine Learning	Atmospheric gravity wav
 es (GWs) exchange momentum between the Earth's surface and free atmosphere.
  Excited by flow over topography\, convective systems\, and jet/front syste
 ms\, they propagate vertically (upward) and horizontally\, and break at hig
 her altitudes where momentum is deposited\, and thus play an important role
  in the momentum budget of jet streams\, and a leading role in the stratosp
 here\, with associated impacts on sub-seasonal to interannual predictabilit
 y. Gravity waves present a challenge to global models: waves on scales of 1
 00m-100km can neither be systematically measured with conventional observat
 ional systems\, nor properly resolved in seasonal or climate prediction mod
 els\, which have resolutions ~25-100 km. They must therefore be parameteriz
 ed based on the resolved flow. Current state-of-the-art parameterizations a
 re hamstrung by computational limitations and scarcity of observations. The
  project includes experts in atmospheric dynamics\, global modeling\, machi
 ne learning (ML)\, and data science and engineering.  Progress on four main

 d Disseminating Solid Mechanics Based Benchmark Datasets	From automobile sa
 fety to surgical planning\, predicting the mechanical behavior of materials
  under loading is an essential step in engineering design. However\, curren
 t approaches to predicting mechanical behavior are often very slow\, where 
 single simulations can take hours or even months to run. Motivated by this 
 limitation\, recent research has leveraged machine learning techniques to r
 apidly predict the behavior of engineered systems and create predictive mod
 els directly from data. Though these emerging techniques have enormous pote
 ntial to benefit society\, current strategies for creating machine learning
  models from mechanical data remain ad hoc. The goal of this research proje
 ct is to change this through disseminating large mechanics-based datasets a
 nd associated scientific resources to the broader community. In addition\, 
 this project provides resources for a cultural shift within the broader mec
 hanics community towards data and code dissemination practices that will al
 low the mechanics research community to make collective research progress m
 ore efficiently.\n\nThe objective of this work is to create and disseminate
  open source benchmark datasets that focus on two broad classes of mechanic
 al challenge: nonlinear material behavior (e.g.\, fracture of engineered co
 mposites)\, and nonlinear structural behavior (e.g.\, large deformation beh
 avior and buckling of engineered metamaterials). In conjunction with datase
 t dissemination\, this work defines and disseminates core challenge problem
 s around emerging and unresolved areas where methodological innovation woul
 d significantly move the solid mechanics field forward such as: (1) full-fi
 eld prediction for nonlinear mechanics\, (2) representation of complex geom
 etries for mechanical prediction\, (3) mechanics-specific out of distributi
 on generalization\, and (4) uncertainty quantification in mechanical proble
 ms. Finally\, this project includes an Open Access Mechanics Dataset Websit
 e and Educational Resource component to collate open access mechanics datas
 ets from the broader research community.	Machine Learning/AI\, Numerical Mo

 riments\, have become a key computational tool for understanding microstruc
 tural evolution and providing a path to control and optimize morphologies a
 nd topologies of structures from nanoscale to microscales.  However\, due t
 o the complexity of interactions between multiple species\, these models ar
 e difficult to parameterize. In this project\, we developed algorithms and 
 software that automate and optimize the selection of thermodynamic and kine
 tic parameters for phase-field simulations of microstructure evolution in m
 ulticomponent systems. Our framework relies on phase-field models that gene
 ralize easily to various multi-component\, multi-phase systems. Therefore\,
  we implemented these phase-field models using high-performing phase-field 
 model solver\, PRISMS-PF\, which employs the deal.II finite element framewo
 rk. The resulting software tool\, the AI-enabled Microstructure Model Build
 ER (AMMBER)\, enables simulations of microstructure evolution using paramet
 ers based on the free energies from empirical databases and atomistic simul
 ations. We have established workflows that takes thermodynamic database and
  extract parameters for a simplified model that are compatible with phase-f
 ield modeling and deploy microstructural simulations without extensive huma
 n intervention. A demonstration of the workflow with a eutectic system is p
 resented.	Machine Learning/AI\, Numerical Modeling\, Data Science\, High Pe

 logies typically require extreme operating conditions\, such as ultra-low t
 emperatures\, minimal noise\, and controlled humidity\, and occupy large ph
 ysical footprints. Notably\, cryogenic cooling alone accounts for approxima
 tely 90% of the total system cost. Conjugated organic molecules\, commonly

 andidates for constructing quantum gates\, a fundamental component of quant
 um information processing. The design of such dyes with targeted properties
  and performance require effective high-throughput screening of a large num
 ber of candidate dye molecules. Over the past project year\, we performed d
 ensity functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations 
 to expand structure&amp\;ndash\;property datasets for dyes. These datasets 
 include molecular structures in SMILES format\, extinction coefficients\, a

 and Charge in Quantum Materials	Nontechnical summary:\nThis award supports 
 computational research and education on the dynamics of quantum materials. 
 Several recently-discovered materials exhibit the potential to store quantu
 m information in individual electrons that may hold the key to the next gen
 eration of quantum computers and quantum communication. Realizing the full 
 potential of these materials requires precise understanding of how long qua
 ntum information can be stored in electron spins and how it disappears even
 tually by interacting with the vibrations of atoms in the material.\n\nThe 
 investigators will develop a computational methodology to simulate quantum 
 dynamics on large supercomputers. They will use this technique to predict h
 ow electron spin changes over times ranging from femtoseconds to microsecon
 ds in several promising materials such as lead halide perovskites containin
 g heavy atoms that couple spin to the movement of electrons. They will also
  investigate the dynamics of electron valley states in transition metal dic
 halcogenides\, another alternative for storing quantum information\, and ho
 w that couples to the spin. For each of these materials\, they will simulat
 e the interaction of these quantum states with extremely short laser pulses
  to interpret experimental measurements of spin and valley dynamics.\n\nThi
 s award will also support the team's effort in increasing participation and
  representation of women in STEM disciplines\, especially in the physical s
 ciences. By integrating simulations into intuitive visualizations using aug
 mented reality\, they will make electron dynamics understandable to undergr
 aduate and high school students. Finally\, this project will strengthen the
  research infrastructure at UCSC\, a Hispanic Serving Institution.\n\nTechn
 ical summary:\nThe goal of this research project is to quantitatively predi
 ct quantum dynamics of electrons with spin\, valley or other internal degre
 es of freedom\, entirely from first principles. The research team will deve
 lop a novel computational methodology and associated massively-parallel ope
 n-source software to rapidly evolve density matrices of quantum materials i
 n a Lindbladian formulation\, with ab initio treatment of electron-electron
 \, electron-phonon and electron-photon interactions. This will facilitate c
 alculation of both coherent dynamics and dephasing of spin or valley polari
 zation\, along with their experimental signatures in ultrafast spectroscopy
 . Using this technique\, they will investigate spin dynamics in systems wit
 h strong spin-orbit coupling and Rashba splitting such as lead halide perov
 skites and ferroelectric oxides\, and valley dynamics in layered transition
  metal dichalcogenides. This fundamentally new predictive capability will f
 acilitate quantitative analysis of ultrafast optical and free electron lase
 r measurements with linear and circular polarization\, and accurate predict
 ions of spin relaxation of quantum materials. This will be critical for the
  design and discovery of new material platforms for spintronics\, valleytro
 nics and quantum information.\n\nThe proposed work will arm the materials r
 esearch community with first-principles quantum dynamics methods in open-so
 urce software. These will include a hierarchy of methods that keep track of
  different levels of coherence\, with corresponding computational requireme
 nts ranging from a small compute cluster to future exascale supercomputers.
  It will thereby deliver a key computational technique necessary for predic
 ting coherent and incoherent ultrafast dynamics in quantum materials\, exte
 nding significantly beyond the capabilities of existing first-principles me
 thods. The work funded in this project responds directly to one of NSF's 10
  Big Ideas: the Quantum Leap\, by facilitating quantitative simulation of s
 pin relaxation and carrier dynamics critical for quantum information scienc
 e. The educational activities associated with this project aim to increase 
 participation and representation of women in STEM disciplines\, especially 
 in the physical sciences. It will expand the reach of materials simulations
  to K-12 education through the platform of augmented reality. This project

 environments. Recent advances in deep learning and GPU architecture have en

 introduces an AI surrogate based on a 4D Swin Transformer to simulate coast

 ct adopts a design-based research approach with two interrelated goals: 1) 
 to meet the pressing need for education in the field of Data Science\, part
 icularly in cybersecurity\, and 2) to advance discipline-based education re
 search in Data Science.  The goals are pursued with two interconnected thru
 sts. Thrust one: Design learning in Data Science with the scaffolding of in
 teractive visualization according to tenets of embodied cognition theories 
 by: a) optimization Data Science learning objectives\; and b) devising Data
  Science learning activities. The learning objective is to build correct an
 d unbiased data science computational solutions. The learning activities fo
 llow a three-phase pedagogical approach: conceptual (learning)\, experiment
 ation (practice)\, and application (evaluation). Thrust two: Evaluate and i
 teratively refine learning activities with the faculties of minoritized ins
 titutions through three-stages\, pilot\, experimental\, and validation proc
 ess. Participants are drawn from an interdisciplinary learning community ac
 ross multiple minority institutions\, such as the University of Houston (HS
 I)\, Prairie View A&amp\;M University (HBCU)\, Alabama A&amp\;M University 
 (HBCU)\, and other partner institutions or companies. This project will adv
 ocate the new data science solutions for cybersecurity with support from th
 e project team consisting of one R1 institution (HSI) and two HBCUs with a 
 strong regional presence.	Data Science\n56	Dhruva Chakravorty	chakravorty@t
 amu.edu	2417929	CyberTraining	CyberTraining: Pilot: PACES: Providing Accele
 rated Cybertraining for Emerging Scientists	With the increased sophisticati
 on of research workflows\, it is essential for researchers to be well-verse
 d in both domain-specific methods\, and cross-cutting cyberinfrastructure (
 CI) technologies. While advanced CI holds tremendous potential to advance r
 esearch\, its success ultimately relies on the ability of researchers to ef
 fectively utilize these technologies to analyze data and gain new insights.
  Leveraging Texas A&amp\;M High Performance Research Computing?s recognized
  researcher-training programs and strengths in AI/ML- enabled research\, PA
 CES\, Providing Accelerated Cybertraining for Emerging Scientists\, will se
 rve as a novel regional CI-centric researcher training avenue that focuses 
 on researchers at emerging research institutions. PACES will offer research
 ers with training opportunities to (i) familiarize themselves with CI\, and
  (ii) use CI to advance CI in their respective fields of science. With a fo
 cus on supporting researchers at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs)\, PAC
 ES will help establish CI training programs at community colleges\, emergin
 g research institutions\, and Tribal Colleges.\n\nPACES will offer asynchro
 nous and live training for researchers at emerging institutions partnering 
 with Texas A&amp\;M University. PACS will offer 2 levels of training to res
 earchers who are keen to apply AI and data science approaches on advanced c
 omputing resources in their scientific fields. The first level is for resea
 rchers from all disciplines who are keen to develop skills and need to use 
 advanced CI. The second level offers specialized training and consulting fo
 r researchers who are keen to address key challenges in the fields of natur
 al hazards\, chemical and materials design\, genomics\, geological sciences
 \, and economics. Monthly virtual training sessions and asynchronous web-ba
 sed training resources will support both tracks. Annual workshops along the
  introductory (2 days) and advanced track (5 days) will be offered.	Data Sc

 earch: Elements: Building an open source DFT+eDMFT database for quantum mat
 erials	The foundation of data-driven novel materials discovery lies in buil
 ding comprehensive databases of electronic structures of quantum materials.
  However\, most existing materials databases rely heavily on density functi
 onal theory (DFT)\, which often fails to capture the physics of quantum mat
 erials governed by strong electron correlations. Here\, we report the devel
 opment of an open-source\, high-fidelity materials database using high-thro
 ughput algorithms based on first-principles DFT combined with embedded dyna
 mical mean field theory (eDMFT)\, capable of accurately describing strongly
  correlated systems. In the first project phase\, we built robust cyberinfr
 astructure and demonstrated a scalable screening strategy to accelerate qua
 ntum materials discovery. This cyberinfrastructure was first applied to alt
 ermagnets\, a new phase of materials exhibiting novel magnetism. In this wo
 rk\, we identified two previously unreported metallic altermagnets among ov
 er 2\,000 magnetic materials. To enable automated workflows\, we also compu
 ted Coulomb repulsion parameters (U) using constrained eDMFT for a broad cl
 ass of materials\, including unconventional superconductors\, Mott insulato
 rs\, and novel magnets. Notably\, U in eDMFT shows less sensitivity to mate
 rial-specific tuning than in DFT+U\, enabling more transferable predictions
  for a diverse set of material classes.	Data Science\, Workflows\, High Per

 3662	CSSI	An A+ framework for multimessenger astrophysics discoveries throu
 gh real-time gravitational wave detection	Gravitational waves - the stretch
 ing and squeezing of space caused by dynamic massive objects such as orbitt
 ing black holes and neutron stars - were first predicted by Einstein over 1
 00 years ago and first directly detected 10 years ago by the US-led LIGO gr
 avitational wave observatories. Today\, gravitational wave observations rou
 tinely change our knowledge about the universe. Our team develops software 
 and services for real-time gravitational wave observation that unifies sign
 al processing and inference infrastructure across a diverse set of tasks fo
 r the LIGO observatories. This framework has directly supported more than 2
 00 gravitational wave discoveries since it was funded and is establishing a
  pathway for AI/ML technologies to transform such discoveries going forward

 : Pilot: Cognitive and Generative AI-driven Cyber-Infrastructure Training P
 latform for Construction Education	The construction industry has the lowest
  digitalization level among all major industries in the US and suffers from
  long-standing challenges\, such as low productivity\, difficulty in effect
 ive collaboration and communication\, and lack of digital skills in the con
 struction workforce. Therefore\, broadening the adoption of digital technol
 ogies and cyber-infrastructures (CI) in the construction industry is a key 
 to its future success and will revolutionize its operations. Building infor
 mation modeling (BIM) is considered as the most significant and promising C
 I in construction\, which refers to a sophisticated process of generating d
 igital representations of the physical and functional characteristics of fa
 cilities. This project will pioneer a new paradigm of integrating generativ
 e AI into the Nation's educational curriculum to train the future scientifi
 c community. The project will develop a BIM CI training framework for const
 ruction education by synergizing generative AI and cognitive science theori
 es. Specifically\, this project will 1) develop undergraduate-level BIM-rel
 ated curriculum materials by incorporating the knowledge space theory from 
 cognitive science to fuse these materials. Expert discussion will be employ
 ed to ensure the quality and suitability of developed materials for undergr
 aduate construction programs in the US\; 2) develop a generative design met
 hod by integrating parametric modeling and computational techniques to auto
 matically produce BIM CI worked examples with various levels of difficultie
 s. These worked examples will serve as a significant supplement to curricul
 um materials\, helping instructors prepare tailored problems for BIM CI tra
 ining\; and 3) explore the feasibility of Generative AI for BIM CI training
 . This project will develop a ChatGPT-based web application as the CI train
 ing platform. The training platform developed from this project can provide
  personalized\, adaptive\, and interactive training to students\, leading t
 he transformation of the educational ecosystem across all engineering field
 s. Extensive experiments will be conducted to validate the developed curric
 ulum materials\, worked examples\, and the training platform. By providing 
 a personalized learning platform\, this project will contribute to the esta
 blishment of deeper engagement with various institutions and underrepresent
 ed groups in Michigan\, the Midwest\, and the US.	Cloud Computing\n3	Mark P

 p@virginia.edu	2411009	CSSI	Elements: A Sustainable\, Resource-Efficient Cy
 berinfrastructure for Notebook Interactive ML Training Workloads	Notebooks 
 are general-purpose programming platforms widely used in machine learning (
 ML)\, artificial intelligence (AI)\, data science\, and data analytics acro
 ss almost every science and engineering field. Despite supporting a wide di
 versity of disciplines\, a dominating application of production Notebook wo
 rkloads is interactive ML training (IMLT). To guarantee high interactivity\
 , modern Notebook services typically allocate and reserve GPU resources for
  actively running Notebook sessions. These Notebook sessions are long-runni
 ng but characterized by intermittent and sporadic GPU usage. Consequently\,
  during most of their lifetimes\, Notebook sessions do not use the reserved
  GPUs\, resulting in extremely low GPU utilization and prohibitively high c
 ost. This project aims to build a new Notebook platform solution for IMLT w
 orkloads to address these issues. The success of the project will provide a
 n efficient and interactive Notebook platform that significantly reduces GP
 U resource wastage. The project will advance understanding in large-scale c
 luster computing systems and gain insights into achieving high carbon effic
 iency and sustainability of large-scale GPU computing infrastructure. The i
 ntegrated educational plan will create a new\, versatile\, educational plat
 form. This will include new pedagogical tools\, new courses\, as well as a 
 proof-of-concept carbon-efficient Notebook service built on energy-efficien
 t computers. This initiative aims to provide graduate and undergraduate stu
 dents with multidisciplinary research and education experiences and develop
  outreach activities for K-12 students.\n\nThis proposal rethinks resource 
 management for large-scale Notebook IMLT workloads by designing a novel\, r
 esource-efficient\, and sustainable cyberinfrastructure called REITOS. The 
 research is organized around several key research thrusts: (1) REITOS will 
 develop distributed Notebook algorithms that replicate the Notebook kernel 
 state for high availability and high interactivity. (2) Distributed Noteboo
 ks will enable a new way for oversubscribing and dynamically sharing signif
 icantly fewer GPU resources. (3) REITOS proposes new GPU cluster scheduling
  algorithms to dynamically preempt or migrate Notebook processes in cluster
  setups. (4) The project will establish a sustainable REITOS community by d
 eveloping and maintaining a healthy GitHub community project that will enco
 mpass the entire REITOS ecosystem. The potential contributions of this proj
 ect are multi-fold: REITOS will enable new capabilities that are urgently r
 equired by existing Notebook platforms\, such as high availability and effi
 cient GPU sharing. The proposed research will create new cyberinfrastructur
 e techniques as standalone\, reusable modules that will be adopted by indep
 endent applications. REITOS will be deployed to active Notebook user commun
 ities at multiple facilities through community outreach and collaborations.

 The DeCODER project builds on the EarthCube GeoCODES effort which takes a d
 ecentralized approach towards data/software discovery through supporting th
 e adoption of science-on-schema by data repositories and promoting the use 
 of peer reviewed notebooks as scholarly objects. DeCODER will take this wor
 k started within the geosciences and expand it into the domains of ecologic
 al forecasting\, low temperature geochemical science\, and deep ocean scien
 ce. By having repositories support a similar means of querying metadata\, a
 pplications such as Google Dataset search and DeCODER can index the data fr
 om across these repositories\, facilitating discoverability as well as conv
 ergence research requiring data from multiple domains. Additionally the eff
 ort provides a customizable open source framework allowing for smaller comm
 unity specific portals to be established\, allowing for the incorporation o

  Multisensor Agile Adaptive Sampling (MAAS) of the Atmosphere	Improving wea
 ther predictability is one of the most challenging scientific endeavors und
 ertaken over the past half-century. Over the last decade\, there have been 
 unprecedented advancements in computational modeling and AI-based inference
  and prediction. To fully harness these advancements\, there is a growing n
 eed to enhance our weather and climate prediction capabilities by acquiring
  new\, targeted data. Meeting these challenges will require transformationa
 l shifts in the computational and observational infrastructures that suppor
 t atmospheric understanding and model prediction.\nThe Radar Science Group 
 at Stony Brook University has developed a prototype computational and commu
 nication cyberinfrastructure (CI) known as the Multisensor Agile Adaptive S
 ampling (MAAS) CI. This system is designed for optimized\, intelligent\, co
 llaborative\, and adaptive atmospheric experimentation. The primary goal of
  the MAAS CI is to significantly improve our ability to sample rapidly evol
 ving atmospheric phenomena by enabling advanced control systems across mult
 iple radar platforms. By supporting real-time\, fine-grained\, and coordina
 ted control of atmospheric observing instruments\, the MAAS framework can r
 evolutionize the study of convective storms. It aims to improve high-resolu
 tion simulations of extreme or high-impact weather events and to facilitate
  integration with emerging technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (U
 AVs) and phased-array radars (PARs).\nIn this context\, we present our late
 st Integrated Project (IP): a hybrid radar network composed of both traditi
 onal reflector-based and next-generation PAR systems\, deployed in Huntsvil
 le\, Alabama. This effort is part of a multi-agency field campaign supporte
 d by the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM)
  user facility and NASA's Investigation of Cumulus Updrafts (INCUS) Cal/Val
  initiatives. The Huntsville IP deployment and MAAS CI demonstration will p
 rovide exposure to field experts and students from a broad consortium of un
 iversities and national laboratories.\nThe MAAS CI will generate multisenso
 r situational awareness data and support real-time decision-making\, which 
 will be made accessible to the broader research community. This openness ai
 ms to foster engagement\, gather feedback\, define requirements\, and guide
  future developments as we prepare to make MAAS CI publicly available. Addi
 tionally\, expert participation in the field campaign is expected to enhanc
 e the intelligence of real-time\, data-driven decision-making processes ess
 ential for optimal atmospheric experimentation.\nThe MAAS CI architecture i
 s designed for flexibility and is intended to evolve through an open-source
 \, community-based development platform. By actively engaging with the broa
 der research community\, we aim to collaboratively implement new methods an
 d tools to continually enhance the MAAS CI's capabilities.	Cloud Computing\

  Generation Software for Distributed Research	The goal of a robust cyberinf
 rastructure (CI) ecosystem is to become a catalyst for discovery and innova
 tion by fostering the development of software frameworks as sustainable pro
 duction-quality services. Modern science and engineering research increasin
 gly span multiple\, geographically distributed data centers and leverage in
 struments\, experimental facilities and a network of national and regional 
 CI. The Tapis framework will enable scientists to accomplish computational 
 and data intensive research in a secure\, scalable\, and reproducible way a
 llowing scientists to focus on their research instead of the technology nee
 ded to accomplish it. Tapis will allow easier implementation\, sharing and 
 re-use of complex computational applications\, workflows\, and infrastructu
 re and enable analysis previously too challenging for researchers. The fram
 ework will maximize application portability\, allowing flexible scheduling 
 of geographically distributed computational workloads\, offer a web-based s
 cience-as-a-service to enable multi-facility\, decentralized deployments\, 
 and provide production-grade support for sensors and streaming data. Tapis 
 will impact multiple science domains\, geographic and underrepresented comm
 unities with the potential to tackle the world's most important scientific 
 problems spanning astronomy\, climate science\, medicine\, natural hazards\
 , and sustainability science. Education and outreach will include sponsored
  workshops\, hackathons and training materials covering the platform and pr
 oviding examples to encourage widespread adoption for users across a variet
 y of technical skills and targeting the next generation of young researcher
 s and professionals through immersive workshops and professional developmen

 g on Accelerating Infrastructure Workloads using Next-Generation SmartNICs/
 DPUs	- Most data today reaches compute nodes as network packets via a Netwo
 rk Interface Card (NIC).\n- SmartNIC/DPU\, a newer type of NIC\, can offloa
 d tasks like networking and security from the host's CPU.\n- While cloud pr
 oviders have adopted SmartNICs\, campus networks\, HPC\, and smaller organi

 l mechanics to enable multi-scale modeling of alloys for Li-ion batteries	F
 unctional materials used in batteries and fuel cells and in logic and memor
 y devices  undergo significant chemical and structural changes during opera
 tion. These non-equilibrium processes remain very challenging to predict an
 d model from first principles and require a hierarchy of multi-scale approa
 ches. Crucial to most multi-scale modeling approaches of non-equilibrium ma
 terials phenomena is the use of surrogate models to interpolate and general
 ize computationally expensive first-principles electronic structure methods
  in Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. This project focuses on
  the development of first-principles statistical mechanics approaches that 
 rely on cluster expansion surrogate models and their implementation in the 
 CASM software package to calculate the essential thermodynamic and kinetic 
 ingredients that inform generalized phase-field models. The software infras
 tructure is being applied in a study of Li-metal alloys for use in all-soli
 d-state Li-ion batteries\, with a particular focus on predicting free energ
 ies and atomic transport coefficients.	Software Development\n2	Aleksei Aksi

  simulation methods is expected to greatly simplify modeling and simulation
  tasks common to research communities specializing in nanoscale transport\,
  plasmonics\, DNA self-assembly\, and biomolecular physics. The project aim

 ted RIS	The evolution of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) opens unprecede
 nted opportunities for flexible\, intelligent\, and cost-efficient wireless
  systems. This poster presents the design and implementation of a cloud-bas
 ed testbed that integrates Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) into a
 n O-RAN-compliant environment. The proposed platform enables remote\, softw
 are-defined control and experimentation with RIS-enhanced beamforming and c
 hannel manipulation in real-time scenarios.\n\nKey components include a mod
 ular O-RAN architecture deployed on a cloud-native infrastructure\, virtual
 ized RAN functions (vRAN)\, and programmable RIS panels interfaced through 
 standardized control protocols. The system supports dynamic adaptation of R
 IS parameters via AI-driven algorithms running on the edge cloud\, demonstr
 ating the impact of RIS on metrics such as coverage\, energy efficiency\, a
 nd signal quality.\n\nThe testbed is designed for researchers and developer
 s to validate novel RIS-assisted RAN strategies\, evaluate interoperability
  with O-RAN components\, and accelerate the development of intelligent wire
 less technologies. Initial experiments confirm enhanced signal steering\, r
 educed interference\, and potential for improved spectral efficiency.	Softw

 calable Open-Source hp-Adaptive FE Software for Complex Multiphysics Applic
 ations	Computer models can be used to augment\, inform\, and even replace e
 xpensive experimental measurements in science and engineering. However\, co
 mplex models of engineering applications can quickly exceed computational c
 apability\, driving the need for advanced simulation tools. Applications in
  high-frequency wave simulation--such as submarine sonar (acoustics)\, fibe
 r optics (electromagnetics)\, and structural analysis (elastodynamics)--pos
 e a significant challenge for large-scale simulation. This project advances
  computational modeling capabilities through the development\, documentatio
 n\, and dissemination of a leading-edge simulation software. The effort bui
 lds on decades-long research and code development by the investigators and 
 their project collaborators. Distributed as open-source\, the software is a
 ccessible to the broader scientific community\, thereby contributing to fun
 damental research and education for computer modeling in science and engine
 ering. Furthermore\, the project expands the national workforce by training
  young computational mathematicians at the graduate and postdoctoral levels
 . The project results are disseminated through conference presentations\, w
 orkshops and seminars\, as well as publications in scientific journals.\n\n
 The hp3D software leverages hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelism to run efficientl
 y on NSF extreme-scale computing facilities and interfaces with state-of-th
 e-art third-party scientific libraries. In addition to publishing the hp3D 
 code and documentation\, this project focuses on the development of a scala
 ble multigrid (MG) solver based on the pre-asymptotically stable discontinu
 ous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) finite element method. This DPG-MG solver represe
 nts a significant advancement in solver technology as 1) the first robust\,
  scalable solver for problems with highly-indefinite operators\, such as hi
 gh-frequency wave propagation\; and 2) the first multigrid solver with supp
 ort for fully anisotropic hp-adaptive hybrid meshes and a reliable built-in
  error indicator. Serial implementations of the DPG-MG solver have demonstr
 ated near-linear scaling with respect to degrees of freedom in both time an
 d memory\; its parallel implementation significantly expands scientific com
 pute capabilities and enables solution of currently intractable problems in
  3D wave simulation.	Software Development\n5	Kaloyan Penev	kaloyan.penev@ut

 from Wide Field Color Images	I will present the current progress of our gro
 up toward developing a free and open-source software and web interface\, ca
 lled WISP\, for extracting high-precision photometry from citizen scientist
  (CzS) observations. WISP will be transformational for wide field observati
 ons obtained with color cameras (e.g. digital single lens reflex or DSLR ca
 meras). Mass production makes these detectors much more affordable than the
  monochrome CCD detectors typically used by professional astronomers\, and 
 the cameras come with a host of built-in features which make such detectors
  much simpler to operate and automate. However\, color images are particula
 rly challenging for existing tools due to the staggered microfilters applie
 d to detector pixels which enable color\nsensitivity. The proposed service 
 will greatly expand the pool of CzS able to contribute to cutting edge scie
 nce\, and enhance their capacity to do so.	Software Development\n6	Bobby Br

 ficient open-source packages for non-perturbative simulations of electron-p
 honon interactions in quantum materials	Understanding and predicting the pr
 operties of quantum materials remains at the forefront of condensed matter 
 physics and materials science research. In these materials\, the strong ele
 ctron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions can produce a 
 highly correlated electron liquid state\, which defies conventional single-
 particle descriptions. As a result\, predictive modeling often relies on no
 nperturbative numerical simulations of low-energy effective Hamiltonians (e
 .g.\, the single- and multi-band Hubbard models). Motivated by this\, the s
 cientific community has developed many open-source codes for performing non
 perturbative simulations of such correlated models in the strongly correlat
 ed regime. However\, most of these tools cannot treat e-ph interactions\, o
 r if they can\, they are limited to unphysical parameter regimes where the 
 phonon's energy is comparable to or larger than the electronic hopping. Thi
 s project thus aims to deliver two open-source and user-friendly packages f

 Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods significantly outperform gradient-free alternati

  emphasizes the integration of users\, developers\, and instructors through
  feedback loops and community-building activities. The primary objectives a

  We achieve our aims by providing learners with various backgrounds exposur

 on Neuroscience Learning and Research	Research and education in neuroscienc

 mes of diverse data to accelerate the study of brain function. A challenge 
 in accomplishing this is the lack of a collaborative framework to enable cr
 oss-disciplinary interactions across biological\, psychological\, and the p
 hysical sciences. The availability of advanced computing resources provides
  new opportunities to address this challenge by developing the necessary fr
 amework and advanced computational tools. This project aims to develop a 15
 -credit graduate certificate that will provide the skillsets and best pract
 ices to accelerate data- and computation-intensive neuroscience research. F
 our campuses of the University of Missouri (UM) system will offer this cert
 ificate to eligible undergraduate and graduate students. Two new courses wi
 ll be developed that integrate advanced computing resources\, funded by NSF
  with new software automation tools. Outreach activities will be conducted 
 to expose students to basic neuroscience software tools\; these engagement 
 programs will recruit high school students and promote participation from s
 tudents in underrepresented and rural communities.\n\nThe project team will
  leverage NSF-funded advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) resources such as FA
 BRIC and CloudLab\, as well as resources at Neuroscience Gateway\, to achie
 ve three key goals. The first goal is to advance CI-based neuroscience educ
 ation modules to increase students? ability to effectively and efficiently 
 utilize software packages requiring high performance computing/cluster comp
 uting\, containerization/hardware acceleration of workloads\, big data mana
 gement\, and other advanced CI resources\, for a broad range of theory and 
 real-world use cases. The second goal is to enhance workforce preparedness 
 and interdisciplinary outcomes in traditional neuroscience courses by incor
 porating experiential learning and assessments of CI-based learning in lowe
 r and higher-level courses. The third goal is to develop new learning modul
 es and tools based on CI technologies to foster next-generation neuroscienc
 e training to further enhance the local and national research infrastructur
 e. In addition\, the training materials will be incorporated in existing co
 urses at UM institutions and summer training workshops that target CI Users
  (e.g.\, scientific domain researchers in neuroscience\, engineering\, psyc

 potential zero-day vulnerability (CVSS 9.0) enabling physical manipulation 
 of safety-critical systems\, demonstrating the intersection of cyber and ph
 ysical security domains.\nThis research advances CI literacy by showcasing 
 practical applications of data-driven security analysis\, network protocol 
 reverse engineering\, and large-scale system vulnerability assessment. The 
 team's methodology - employing industry-standard tools like can-utils\, dev
 eloping custom exploitation scripts\, and analyzing complex vehicular netwo
 rks provides a model for integrating discipline-appropriate CI skills into 
 cybersecurity curricula.\nKey educational outcomes include hands-on experie
 nce with embedded system security\, API vulnerability analysis revealing pl
 aintext credential exposure and rate-limiting gaps\, and practical threat m
 odeling of interconnected transportation infrastructure. The findings under
 score the importance of CI-enabled research in addressing real-world securi
 ty challenges affecting public safety.\nThis work exemplifies how advanced 
 CI tools and methods can catalyze major research advances in transportation
  cybersecurity while preparing the next generation of security professional
 s with the computational and analytical skills essential for protecting our
  nation's critical infrastructure. The documented vulnerabilities and mitig
 ation strategies serve as valuable instructional materials for undergraduat
 e and graduate cybersecurity education programs.	critical CI\, CI Training\

 	Modern Course Exemplars infused with Parallel and Distributed Computing fo
 r the Introductory Computing Course Sequence	The goal of this project is to
  overcome a key impediment that has prevented educators from updating intro
 ductory computer science curricula to address current systems: a lack of ex
 amples of modernized courses. Since parallel and distributed computing is a
  core component of modern computing infrastructure\, the project will resul
 t in an overall modernization of the future research workforce\, and enable
  more effective use of advanced cyberinfrastructure resources by a larger s
 et of researchers than is now possible. The project is designing a modern f
 irst year introductory computer science course sequence\, based on a concep
 tual model that includes the fundamental elements of parallel and distribut
 ed computation as found in current systems. The sequence is being implement
 ed at two colleges\, using two different programming languages\, to demonst
 rate the generality of the model. Six additional institutions\, selected fo
 r diversity (size\, schedule\, student population\, connections to other in
 stitutions such as community colleges\, etc.)\, have been recruited to subs
 equently adopt and evaluate the new course sequence\, and thus discover enh
 ancements that expand its potential for widespread use\, as well as providi
 ng evidence of effectiveness. Instructors at the additional institutions ar
 e going through intensive summer training workshops to learn how to use cou
 rse evaluation instruments and how to adopt the new course designs.	Curricu

 adening Adoption of Parallel and Distributed Computing in Undergraduate Com
 puter Science and Engineering Curricula	\nThis collaborative project repres
 ents a multi-faceted effort to shift computer science and engineering educa
 tion toward ensuring that students can use 21st century platforms that perv
 asively incorporate parallel and distributed computing (PDC). To turn the t
 ide toward infusing PDC into the early stages of computer science and engin
 eering education\, this project will guide curricula and accreditation stan
 dards\, prepare teachers\, and foster a strong PDC education community. The
  Center for Parallel and Distributed Computing Curriculum Development and E
 ducational Resources (CDER) is preparing the 2020 update of their 2013 curr
 iculum guidelines for introducing parallel and distributed computing (PDC) 
 into early undergraduate courses. This project will engage in four areas of
  activity to foster adoption of the curriculum\, and extend it\, with the g
 oal of modernizing computer science and engineering workforce development. 
 One major thrust is running summer training workshops for teachers\, to lea
 rn both PDC concepts and experimental course evaluation methodology. The wo
 rkshop participants will be drawn from a diverse pool of educators\, and gi
 ven curriculum development grants in support of experimental course offerin
 gs and evaluation\, leading to conference or journal publications\, as well
  as contributions of exemplars to the CDER online course materials reposito
 ry. A second effort is expanding the curriculum guidelines to explicitly ad
 dress adding PDC to computer engineering programs\, which present novel cur
 ricular opportunities. Third\, it will continue CDER's successes in organiz
 ing PDC education workshops in conjunction with major conferences\, publish
 ing PDC education books and journal special issues\, maintaining and curati
 ng an online repository of PDC education resources\, and providing free acc
 ess to a publicly available PDC education cluster system.\n	\n55	Weiwen Jia

 ederated Function as a Service	Exploding data volumes\, diverse hardware pl
 atforms\, and event-driven science demand new computational models that are
  mobile\, composable\, and scalable. Globus Compute is a federated Function
 -as-a-Service (FaaS) platform that enables secure\, high-performance execut
 ion of Python functions across a broad range of distributed systems—from 
 laptops and clusters to clouds and supercomputers. It allows functions to b
 e executed near data\, triggered by events\, or offloaded to specialized re
 sources without requiring users to manage infrastructure. Recent enhancemen
 ts include a high-assurance multi-user endpoint that can be deployed by adm
 inistrators and then used by users of that system with flexible identity ma
 pping\, high assurance policies\, and templated configuration.  Globus Comp
 ute is well-suited for dynamic workloads such as near-real-time experimenta
 l analysis\, bag-of-tasks applications\, scientific workflows\, and as a fo
 undation for building new scientific services.	\n57	Kyle Chard	chard@uchica

 buted Data	Increasingly distributed CI is enabling exciting discoveries in 
 many domains\, but also leads to difficulties for researchers who must mana
 ge\, discover\, and act upon large volumes of distributed data. Growing amo
 unts of valuable research time is spent on mundane but necessary data manag
 ement tasks\; crucial data are lost\; important provenance information cann
 ot be determined\; and analyses are repeated. To tackle these problems\, th
 is project is building Globus Search\, a new capability integrated into the
  widely used Globus platform\, that will enable the creation of\, and searc
 h within and across\, distributed Globus collections. By thus allowing rese
 archers to easily discover data regardless of location\, group data into "v
 irtual" collections\, and act on virtual collections irrespective of where 
 individual files reside\, Globus Search will allow even the largest and mos

  scalable and flexible online platform for web-based training in climate an
 d environmental sustainability	\nAddressing the current challenges in clima
 te\, water and environmental (CWE) sustainability requires knowledge and sk
 ills of big data analytics\, simulations\, high-performance computing\, and
  advanced cyberinfrastructures. Yet\, there are inadequate training opportu
 nities on integrating and working with big data from different sources\, in
 cluding application of machine learning and artificial learning. Additional
 ly\, existing curriculum at many institutions do not train students to make
  their research open and accessible to the broader community. Our ongoing w
 ork aims to fill this gap by creating a CyberTraining curriculum for CWE su
 stainability that builds on previous successes and incorporates rapidly-dev
 eloping technology and community best practices in Findable Accessible Inte
 roperable and Reusable (FAIR) Science. This curriculum is implemented by de
 veloping a scalable and flexible online platform called CyberFaCES (Cybertr
 aining for FAIR science in Climate and Environmental Sustainability). It ha
 s an easy-to-use template to guide instructors to create and publish their 
 online modules and courses. Instructors can develop learning modules that m
 eet the learning needs at three levels: foundation level provides basic tra
 ining that can be used across multiple disciplines\; the expert level teach
 es domain specific data and computation knowledge\; and developer level foc
 uses on advanced CI skills necessary to create solutions for complex resear
 ch problems. Instructors can reuse learning modules or dynamically construc
 t courses consisting of modules at different levels. Students can get hands
 -on coding experience using Jupyter Notebook with access to HPC resources. 
 Students can also earn badges and certificates by completing learning modul
 es and courses. This poster presents an overview of the CyberFaCES platform
 \, the structure of modules\, and outcome from engagement/dissemination act
 ivities.\n	\n59	Christopher Wolverton	c-wolverton@northwestern.edu	2311203	
 CSSI	Elements: Phonon Database Generation\, Analysis\, and Visualization fo
 r Data Driven Materials Discovery	Inorganic material databases such as Mate
 rials Project\, ICSD\, OQMD\, and AFLOW and their related computing infrast
 ructures have become the major cornerstone of current data driven and artif
 icial intelligence based materials discovery. These databases have been rou
 tinely and exhaustively used by researchers from different disciplines for 
 screening materials with unusual properties. However\, what is still requir
 ed by the community is a comprehensive database of phonon properties \, the
  lattice vibrations in crystalline materials\, which play a critical role i
 n phase stability\, solid state physics\, thermal transport\, superconducto

 y. This project meets these urgent needs to generate a comprehensive phonon
  database along with analysis\, navigation\, and visualization tools\, whic
 h will be an excellent complement to the currently widely used material dat
 abases. Developing such an infrastructure will be beneficial for all areas 
 of materials science and engineering\, accelerating the prediction\, design

  Paleoclimate Studies	To better understand how climate may change in the fu

 leoclimatology. Doing so requires the use of proxies such as the rings of t
 rees or the chemical composition of ice cores to infer climate variability 
 over decades to millions of years. Given the importance of these datasets\,
  it is crucial that scientists have the ability to efficiently locate\, acc

 n of hundreds of datasets that are stored in unstructured files\, currently
  requiring scientists to spend a significant fraction of their time manuall

 o make more data available to more scientists\, to reduce the time scientis
 ts spend on data wrangling\, to decrease the time it takes to obtain scient

 erformed by different research groups. Working with collaborators from the

  for estimating the state of a\ndynamical system from imperfect observation
 s\; Bayesian estimation theory provides a mathematical\nfoundation for data
  assimilation. In applications like weather and Earth system prediction and
  reanalysis\,\nthe dynamics involve from tens of millions to billions of de
 grees of freedom\, and many workhorse methods like\nMarkov Chain Monte Carl
 o and particle filters are too expensive to use. The two state-of-the-art\n
 classes of methods for large-scale applications of this kind are Ensemble K
 alman filters (EnKFs)\nand hybrid ensemble-variational methods (EnVar). Bot
 h of these methods require an ensemble\nforecast\, preferably a large one\,
  which can be extremely expensive for high-resolution or coupled\nEarth sys
 tem models. EnKFs are built on a Gaussian assumption\, which is the main li
 miting factor\nin the performance of EnKFs in systems with strongly non-Gau
 ssian forecast (prior) distributions.\n\nThis project has produced powerful
  new methods for reducing the cost of an ensemble forecast\,\nand for gener
 alizing the EnKF to non-Gaussian distributions. The EnKF already scales to 
 massive\napplications\, so by building carefully within the algorithmic fra
 mework of the EnKF the resulting\nmethods also scale efficiently. Machine l
 earning methods have been developed to reduce the cost of large\nensemble f
 orecasts by reducing the number of costly physics-based forecasts to just o
 ne\, or a small\nnumber\, followed by the use of generative models to creat
 e a large ensemble of synthetic analogs\nof the physics-based forecasts. Ne
 w methods have been implemented within the open source Data\nAssimilation R
 esearch Testbed (DART) developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Res
 earch\n(NSF-NCAR). DART incorporates over 30 geophysical models including t
 he Community Earth System \nModel (CESM) and the Weather Research and Forec
 asting Hydrologic model (WRF-Hydro\, which is the\ncore of the National Wat
 er Model)\, so that the new methods produced here are immediately available
 \nto a wide range of researchers.	Machine Learning/AI\, Data Science\, Soft

 I	Adaptive Experimentation in Education	Rigorous randomized field trials ar
 e rare in education\, and adaptive experiments are even more rare\, but ada
 ptive experiments have the potential to substantially accelerate our abilit
 y to discover and provide effective educational experiences to students. Th
 is poster describes the main components of our field experimentation system
  and the changes that we have made to allow experiments to automatically ad
 apt to features and content that appears to be most effective for students.
  We argue that\, in cases where reliable and timely metrics are available t
 o drive the adaptation\, this approach is very promising. One particularly 
 interesting application of adaptive experimentation is in testing different
  approaches to building generative AI models that provide instruction to st
 udents. Such models may vary based on foundational training\, fine-tuning a
 nd prompting in a wide variety of ways. Correctly configured\, adaptive exp
 erimentation can support "never ending experiments\," in which prompting st
 rategies are continually evaluated and compete based on their ability to dr
 ive student outcomes. Future work will explore algorithms that allow us to 
 discover whether certain models work better for particular content or stude
 nts.	Machine Learning/AI\, Data Science\, Software Development\n52	David La

 (3) how to construct a flexible and extensible data-driven classification s

 d monitoring	Forests cover one-third of Earth's land and hold the most terr
 estrial biodiversity. Accurate 4D mapping of forest structure and above gro
 und biomass through time is vital for human health\, resource management\, 
 carbon monitoring\, and ecological hazards mitigation (e.g.\, wildfires). W
 hile traditional in-situ measurements provide the most accurate measurement
 s\, they are impractical at large scales. Airborne and terrestrial lidar en
 able detailed forest mapping but remain cost prohibitive for regional to co
 ntinental scales\, especially for measuring changes over time. Space-based 
 remote sensing provides a fast\, cost-effective way to assess global forest
  structure and biomass\, with satellites collecting data more frequently th
 an ground or low-altitude surveys. However\, while global in scale\, these 
 are mostly sampling missions that collect profile data and cannot produce h
 igh resolution wall-to-wall maps of forest structure or above ground biomas
 s at ~30m resolution\, required for effective forest management. Recent stu
 dies have shown that fusing spaceborne lidar\, C-band synthetic aperture ra
 dar (SAR)\, and optical data using AI and advanced statistical models can a
 ccurately scale up sparse above ground biomass estimates to a 30-100m resol
 ution.\n\nCurrently\, there are no frameworks to efficiently calculate (1) 
 forest structure from existing airborne remote sensing data sources and (2)
  above ground biomass\nvia seamless access to and integration of the spaceb
 orne datasets (a data science challenge)\, nor a platform that enables effi
 cient data processing using validated processing algorithms\, statistical m
 odels and AI approaches. The OpenForest4D science gateway aims to fill this
  gap by enabling users to generate on-demand\, up-to-date\, research-grade 
 forest structure and above ground biomass estimates using multiple types of
  airborne and satellite remote sensing data and advanced processing algorit

 cology: A Platform for Facilitating Computational and Quantitative Skills i
 n Undergraduate Ecology Courses	While the data streams that scientists use 
 to understand ecological systems have increased exponentially in the last f
 ew decades\, the spread of quantitative and computational skills needed to 
 work with these burgeoning data streams has lagged behind. One part of addr
 essing this issue is incorporating computational and data-centric approache
 s into undergraduate ecology classes and curricula. However\, doing so stil
 l requires substantial investment and expertise on the part of the instruct
 or. The instructor may need to manage infrastructure and be able to guide s
 tudents through computational tasks while still delivering on the other com
 ponents of a holistic ecology curriculum. To help alleviate some of these c
 hallenges\, we are working to build a new freely available resource for eco
 logy educators called "Data4Ecology". Building on the established STATS4STE
 M platform\, this new site will enable instructors to assign content\, supp
 ort student learning\, and assess student progress through an integrated on
 line platform. This platform will focus on developing student skill in work
 ing with data in a variety of modalities\, while also providing a specific 
 focus on the use of the R programming language. With content drawn from exi
 sting open data repositories such as those from the LTER and NEON programs\
 , the platform will lower the barrier to including quantitative and computa
 tional material into undergraduate ecology courses. We are coordinating our
  initial lesson development efforts with the team behind the open and freel
 y available ecology textbook called Ecology for All in order to provide a c
 onvenient 'off the shelf' open and free set of resources for ecology educat
 ors to use in their classrooms. When complete\, this platform will provide 
 a new resource for ecology educators nationwide looking to help their stude
